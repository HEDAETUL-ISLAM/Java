Click and Score



The Game looks like this. There are one label to count score, Ten Buttons for Playing the game and One
Button for Exiting the game.When the game starts, a thread is turned on to change the color of a random button. Whenever the color
of a button is changed, you have to click on that button. For example, let us consider that our buttons
are initially red. Whenever the color of a button turns to green, you have to click on that button. The
more you click on green button, the more your score will be. If you click on any red button, your score
will be deducted.
