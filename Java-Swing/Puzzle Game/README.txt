Puzzle Matching


The Game looks like this. There are ten buttons (five buttons of two different colors) and a label to
display score.Each pair of buttons have a number as their text. This text is apparently invisible as both the foreground
and background of buttons are same. Whenever you click a button, its foreground becomes black and
the text becomes visible. Now if you click another button, the text of both the buttons is checked. If the
text is same, both the buttons vanishes. If the texts are not same, the text of both the buttons becomes
invisible again. For each wrong move, score is deducted. The game continues until all the buttons
vanishes. A message box pops up displaying the score when all the buttons vanishes. A GUI becomes
visible when the message box goes down. This new GUI asks a player to play again or to exit.
