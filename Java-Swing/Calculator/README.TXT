Its a simple calculator.

 Design a simple calculator with 10 numeric buttons (from 0 to 9), 1 point button (for decimal point),
5 operator buttons (+, -, *, /, =), 1 backspace button, 1 ClearAll button and 1 Off button.
 You may use any one of JLabel, JTextField or JTextArea for making the calculator screen. If you use
JTextField or JTextArea, make sure they are not editable.
 The calculator should perform the basic arithmetic operations ( + , - , * , / ).
Hint:
i.
Initially the display screen shows either nothing or a zero.
ii.
Whenever a numeric button is clicked, value of that button is showed on the screen.
Example: if 6 is clicked, the screen shows 6. If 1 is clicked after 6, 61 is showed on the screen.
iii. Whenever any of the +, -, *, / button is pressed, the value shown on the screen is stored in a
variable and the screen shows either nothing or a zero.
iv. Step ii is repeated until the = button is clicked.
v.
Whenever = button is clicked, the value showed on the screen is stored in another variable
and calculation is done with the two variables according to the operator clicked in Step iii.

Sample Calculation:
617 + 912 = 1529
50.2 + 6.2 = 56.4
912 – 617 = 295
50.2 – 6.2 = 44
12 * 2 = 24
12 / 2 = 6
